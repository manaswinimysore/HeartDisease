# HeartDisease

Description:

This project describes about the prediction of occurrence of heart disease in a patient when all the values are provided.

For this project I have taken UCIâ€™s Hungarian Heart disease data set.
The columns in the dataset are

1.  (age) :age in years
3. (cp):chest pain type 
-- Value 1: typical angina 
-- Value 2: atypical angina 
-- Value 3: non-anginal pain 
-- Value 4: asymptomatic 
4. (trestbps) :resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) 
5.  (chol) :serum cholestoral in mg/dl 
6.  (fbs) (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) 
7.  (restecg):resting electrocardiographic results 
-- Value 0: normal 
-- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV) 
-- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria  
8.  (thalach) :maximum heart rate achieved 
9.  (exang) :exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) 
10.  (oldpeak) = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
11.  (slope) :the slope of the peak exercise ST segment 
-- Value 1: upsloping 
-- Value 2: flat 
-- Value 3: downsloping 
12.  (ca) :number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy 
13.  thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect 
14.  (num) (the predicted attribute) :diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) 
-- Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing 
-- Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing 
(in any major vessel: attributes 59 through 68 are vessels)
